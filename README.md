### Experience Ken Kocienda's early iteration of the original iPhone keyboard.

**[work in progress]**

I‚Äôm teaching a tech design history course in Paris, sharing the history of the mouse, the GUI, the iPhone, even the Newton, and much more with hundreds of design students (and I'm opening it as a [workshop for UX/UI design professionals](http://juliendorra.com/atelier-histoire-ux/en/) too!).

Ken Kocienda's keyboard development for the iPhone is one of the key innovation stories of my course.

The blob keyboard is the first iteration of what would become the iPhone touchscreen keyboard. The blob keyboard was born out of necessity, following a total UX crisis brought upon the team because of the unknown unknows of creating a keyboard on a small piece of glass. Read more about it [in this interview](https://qz.com/1380188/ken-kocienda-qa) or even better in [Kocienda's book Creative Selection](http://creativeselection.io).

Each year, I make the class **even more tangible with props, manuals, packaging, demos, and real vintage device hands-on**. This gives the the students a chance to really understand how devices like the first iPhone 2G were experienced. 

But manipulating the shipped experience  is not telling you the whole design story.

So I had this crazy idea: let's build a Blob Keyboard simulator üòÖ so they can *feel* the design iterations.

You can test it here: https://juliendorra.github.io/blob-keyboard-simulator/blob-keyboard-simulator.html

Here are the limitations of the original prototype as explained by Ken Kocienda:

 - Moving the cursor didn't exist at the time of this demo. It came later with the loupe.
 - There was no backspace. You couldn't delete or go back.
 - No capitals either.
 - No animation. Pressed keys just popped, but your eye filled in the details and it felt like it ‚Äúmoved‚Äù because of the shapes.
